I went to Twitter.com for this assignment. Looking at the network traffic right after opening the page, there were
two files 'client_event.json' and 'p2' transferred over the network. Without scrolling, I did not observe any network events.
However, as soon as I started scrolling, dozens of other network files started pouring in. These files were mainly things like
jpg's or video segments, but others were json files or misc. These files came from a variety of domains such as video.twimg.com,
 pbs.twimg.com, api.twitter.com, and others.

It was interesting to see this all at work.
